# Final Walkthrough & Deployment

I have completed the scrollytelling visualization and prepared it for deployment.

## Project Status
-   **Visualization**: Fully implemented with D3.js, Scrollama, and Leaflet.
-   **Data**: Processed and integrated.
-   **Deployment**: Configured for Vercel.

## How to Deploy
I have created a `README.md` file with detailed instructions. Here is the summary:

1.  **Install Vercel CLI** (if you have Node.js):
    ```bash
    npm i -g vercel
    ```
2.  **Deploy**:
    ```bash
    vercel
    ```
    Follow the prompts in your terminal.

Alternatively, you can push this folder to **GitHub** and import it on the Vercel website.
